Learn all you need to know about the ETH merge.

# What is The Ethereum Merge?
The Ethereum Merge is a network update to transition Ethereum from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. There is an expected 99% reduction in energy costs associated with processing Ethereum transactions.

The Merge is the most significant upgrade in the history of Ethereum. Extensive testing and bug bounties were undertaken to ensure a safe transition to proof-of-stake. So what exactly is The Merge? The Merge is the union of Ethereum's new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus layer, the Beacon Chain, with its current execution layer (the Mainnet that we now use).

*Key points:*

- The existing Ethereum Mainnet and the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake network will soon converge.
- This will complete Ethereum's shift to proof-of-stake and signal the end of proof-of-work. 
- This paves the way for later scaling improvements like sharding. Ethereum's energy use will be reduced by 99.95% as a result of the Merge.

# What is The Merge?

Instead of using energy-intensive mining, it uses staked ETH to safeguard the network. An incredibly exciting step toward achieving the scalability, security, and sustainability goals of Ethereum.

It's vital to keep in mind that the Beacon Chain first shipped apart from Mainnet. Even while the Beacon Chain uses PoS, the Ethereum Mainnet, together with all of its accounts, balances, smart contracts, and blockchain data, is still protected by PoW. When these two systems eventually converge at the next Merge, proof-of-stake will completely replace proof-of-work.

# Merging with Mainnet:

Mainnet has been protected by PoW since its inception. It holds each transaction, smart contract, and balance since Ethereum's launch in July 2015. This is the Ethereum blockchain that we are all familiar with. Since the beginning of Ethereum, programmers have been working diligently to get the platform ready for a potential switch from PoW to PoS. The Beacon Chain was established on December 1, 2020, and it has since functioned alongside Mainnet as a separate blockchain. Transactions on the Mainnet have not been handled by the Beacon Chain.

Instead, it has agreed on active validators and their account balances in order to gain consensus on its own state. The time for the Beacon Chain to agree on more is now approaching after lengthy testing. Including execution layer transactions and account balances, the Beacon Chain will serve as the consensus engine for all network data following The Merge. The Beacon Chain will now be the official mechanism for producing blocks as of the Merge. Valid blocks can no longer be created by mining. Instead, the PoS validators take on this responsibility and are in charge of processing all transactions' legitimacy and submitting blocks. The history is not erased. The complete transactional history of Ethereum will be unified as Mainnet and Beacon Chain are combined.

# Getting Ready:
The Merge is one of the biggest and most anticipated upgrades in Ethereum history, and while everyone will eventually feel the effects of it, some people will need to take immediate steps to be fully ready.

# Hodlers and Users:
To keep your money safe as it enters The Merge, there is nothing you need to do. You do not need to take any action with your money or wallet prior to The Merge if you are an Ethereum user or holder of ETH or any other digital asset on Ethereum, including a non-node-operating stake.

After switching to proof-of-stake, Ethereum's complete history going back to its creation is still preserved and unchanged. After The Merge, you will still be able to access any money that was in your wallet prior to The Merge. You don't need to do anything. You should be extremely vigilant for scammers attempting to take advantage of people during this transition as The Merge of Ethereum Mainnet draws closer. Never give ETH to anyone or anywhere in an effort to "upgrade to ETH2." There is no such thing as an "ETH2" token, and you are done.

# After The Merge:
This will mark the end of Ethereum's PoS era and usher in a more environmentally friendly and long-lasting Ethereum. Additionally, this will pave the way for additional scalability improvements not achievable under PoW, advancing Ethereum toward realizing its ultimate scale, security, and sustainability. There are guidelines to follow and instructions to take note of for Node operators and Dapp developers in order to get ready for The Merge. Unfortunately, this topic is not handled in this discussion.
